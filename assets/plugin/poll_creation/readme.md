# Readme poll_creation
This is not a plugin like you know it from other projects.
It is growed from the powerpoint add-in and is used to be included from the django application. 
Because the fact that it only has static files, it is in the assets folder.
It could actually be an django app, but as wrote, it is growed from the source-cloze-office (add-in). So it has a history, we could say.
