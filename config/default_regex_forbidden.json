// Summery of regular expression which should be checked for each answer of a poll result.
// If a answer contains a regex. it will not be compiled/executed.
// each Regex (eg "eval") will be transformed like: (.*?)eval(.*?)
// that means eval would also be found in the middle of the string
// make sure to encode the encoders
// Example:
// 		regex: eval\\(.*?\\) will be transformed to actuall regex: (.*?)eval\(.*?\)(.*?)
//		and will catch strings like: eval(), eval(foo...), fooeval(), fooeval()bar, eval()bar
//		but not: eval foo
//
// ----> ! After updating, please restart application ! <----
// It is also possible to add regular expressions through the GUI
//	visit for that: <your_url>/admin/poll_api/forbiddenexectext
